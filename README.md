# Clicker
This code is a user-friendly way of implementing an autoclicker. 
It allows you to input the co-ordinates of the click, the number of clicks and the time interval of the click.

I made this code while taking a course so I could automatically skip through the pages without pressing the button each time, ik, im really lazy.
This is my first project, so feel free to make a pull request.

You could even use this code to leave a zoom meeting without clicking your keyboard, allowing you to blame it on your wifi :)

You need to import 2 libraries to run this code:
1. pyautogui
2. from the time library import sleep
